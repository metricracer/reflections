When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When developing on multiple machines

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Could messup what your are working on

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is like clone but it exists on GitHub.
    Clone is to make a seperate copy.
    Branch is a new direction for an existing repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Make sure you are working on the latest changes

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Very hard. You would need to sync the files by hand.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    The master branch is golden.  Never checkin directly.
